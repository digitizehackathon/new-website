Instructions on Using Sublime Text to Edit Website
1. If you haven't download sublime text (or another text editor)
2. Go to Github and click on "Clone or Download"
	- copy that link
3. Go into your terminal (or Command Prompt for windows users)
4. Type in the following commands 
	git clone [insert the copied link]
	mkdir ~/website
	cd ~/website
	git init website
5. Then open sublime text and go to file > open > users > [your computer name] > website
	- note that it may vary on your computer but if you look at the lines in terminal, you can follow those instructions to find your file. EX: mine says after I type mkdir ~/website
	mkdir: /Users/annazhang/website: File exists
6. Then you should be able to open the website repo with everything and you can edit it nicely :)
7. Once you are done editing, go back to Terminal and type the following : 
	git add . 
	git commit -m "[insert whatever commit message that describes what you changed]"
	git push
8. It will ask for your github username and password, so put it in
9. Then you can go to github and it should show everything you changed!
10. If you go back later to make edits make sure you type in git pull to retrieve any edits that someone else may have made on github
